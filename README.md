# Personal Project - Full-Stack Web Application Practice

This repository houses a personal project designed to enhance my full-stack development skills. The goal is to build a complete web application from scratch, covering UI, backend, database, and deployment, while incorporating JWT-based authentication. This project serves as practical experience and exploration of various technologies.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a functional web application that I can manage my projects on. Im thinking a mix between Asana and GitHub Projects to use myself. It encompasses the following key components:

- **Frontend (UI):** Built using React + Vite. The frontend focuses on providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application. The key functionality will be revolve around project management and keeping track of personal tasks.

- **Backend (API):** Developed with Express.js. The backend will handle API requests, business logic, and interacts with the database. It also will contain an implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication for secure access.

- **Database:** Utilizing PostgreSQL. The database will stores the application's data.

- **Authentication:** Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to secure API endpoints. This ensures that only authorized users can access protected resources.

- **Deployment:** The application will be deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Technologies Planning to Use

- **Frontend:** [React](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/)
- **Backend:** [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **Authentication:** [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/)
- **Cloud Platform:** [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- **Other Tools:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
